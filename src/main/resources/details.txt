Assume application will be distributed as Docker image. 
Provide Dockerfile, but don’t waste too much time for building and testing docker image, focus on functionality. 
Assume importance levels:
S
1 – Code working as described in requirements,
2 – Application is building with simple javac, mvn install or gradle build command (or any basic build command working on behalf of programming language you choose),
3 - Unit tests are included. Coverage level depends on time you have left to complete the assignment, but we would like to see business logic (service layer) coverage at 60%,
4 – Other things you would like to implement for this project (ex. Database, application test coverage over 90%, API for gathering different statistics,  UI or whatever else you think would make your application extraordinary),
